# 2026-02-08 - OpenClaw Platform UI Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the React UI "Loading..." stuck state on the OpenClaw Platform.

### Root Cause
Next.js static files (`/_next/static/`) were returning 404 errors because:
1. The standalone build didn't include the static files
2. Nginx wasn't configured to proxy those requests to the web container

Browser console showed:
```
Refused to execute script from '...' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable
```

### Solution
1. **Dockerfile** (`web/Dockerfile`): Added line to copy static files into standalone build:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/
   ```

2. **Nginx config** (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/openclaw`): Added location block:
   ```nginx
   location /_next/static/ {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/_next/static/;
       expires 1y;
       add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
   }
   ```

### Result
- UI now loads correctly with Login/Register forms
- Full authentication flow working
- Platform URL: https://ip-10-0-24-43.tail9f77e8.ts.net/platform/
